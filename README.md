# SilentGuardians-RNAi: Characterization of RNA Silencing in Monocotyledonous Plants

Welcome to the repository for my end-of-studies project focused on the characterization of RNA silencing in plant viruses within monocotyledonous plants.

## Project Overview

Plant viruses pose a significant threat to global agriculture, exacerbated by climate change and monoculture practices. Traditional control methods are often challenging and costly, prompting exploration into alternative approaches. Artificial RNA interference (RNAi), leveraging the natural mechanism of RNA silencing, offers a promising solution.

## Objectives

  **Dataset Selection:** Select monocot plants from the SRA database for analysis.
  **Bioinformatic Pipeline:** Develop a bioinformatics pipeline to detect viral infections using small RNA-sequencing data.
  **Mechanistic Study:** Investigate RNA silencing mechanisms in three plant-virus systems.
  **Model Proposal:** Propose a model to characterize RNA silencing mechanisms in monocot plants.

## Impact

This research aims to deepen our understanding of RNA silencing in monocots, an area less studied compared to dicots. By elucidating these mechanisms, we aim to contribute to the development of more effective virus control strategies, ensuring food security and sustainability for farmers worldwide.
