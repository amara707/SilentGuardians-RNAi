In this project, I followed a structured pipeline to produce results:
 
    1.Quality Check: Used FastQC and MultiQC to assess the quality of raw reads.
    2.Adapter Removal: Tested Cutadapt, Trimmomatic, and BBduk; utilized Cutadapt for adapter trimming.
    3.Read Filtering: Filtered clean reads longer than 18 nts using CutAdapt.
    4.De Novo Assembly: Evaluated Velvet and Trinity; used Trinity for contig assembly.
    5.Assembly Validation: Employed QUAST to verify assembly quality.
    6.Contig Filtering: Used BBMap's reformat.sh to filter contigs longer than 700 nts.
    7.Database Preparation: Created a custom plant virus database with makeblastdb.
    8.Sequence Alignment: Locally aligned contigs to the virus database using Blastn.
    9.Result Processing: Developed a custom script to extract best hits for each sample.
    10.Mapping: Utilized BWA for read mapping.
    11.Visualization: Used Tablet for visualization and verification of mapping results.
    12.Coverage Analysis: Employed SAMtools for coverage and depth calculation.
